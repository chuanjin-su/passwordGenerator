## Welcome to Chuanjin's Password Generator!

### What is it?

This is a deterministic password generator, which generate a deterministic strong password given three keywords.

What you have to do is just keep the three words in your memory, and use this generator to look up your complex password!

### How to generate my password?

For example, Chuanjin has a google account. He inputs "Goog", "Chuanjin", "Bazinga!" as the three keys, and the application returns "u?4y4yeh" as his password!

**But be careful,** the first key should not be empty, while others can be whatever you want. It's highly recommended that the first key has a length that can divide the "minimum length". 

### Well... I can't even memorize my keys

Fortunately, this application permits you to Log your hints in "MY LOGS", just push the button and explore it! You may write down some non-sense hint according to your keys, which will be nothing but a shit for others!

### What's your algorithm?

It's based on a non-sense hash function, and a non-sense random dictionary. But keep in mind:

> The important thing is not to generate a super strong password, but to change the password frequently,  and to use different passwords for every accounts.
